Azure HTTP Insert Bulk Copy

This is an Azure function implementation of SQL Bulk Copy.
This project is a straight-forward high performance Bulk Insert.
The HTTP function takes a table name and a list of json objects and using dynamic mapping, inserts them into the sql table.

Performance graphs will be posted soon.
